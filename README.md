# DexDump
See decompiled code for android applications on your device.

As you update to Android 5.0 lollipop you may find that user installed apks are in /data/app/package-name/base.apk instead of /data/app. This breaks dexdump (by IT PLUS on google play store). To make it to work again, I modified parts of the source code of the app and now it should work without any problems.

Note: for system apks and frameworks, I will come up with a solution later.
