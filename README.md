# DexDump by IT PLUS
This app allows you to see decompiled smali code for android applications directly on your Android devices.

As you update to Android 5.0 lollipop you may find that user installed apks are in /data/app/package-name/base.apk instead of /data/app. This breaks DexDump (by IT PLUS on google play store). To make it to work again, I modified parts of the source code of the app (with the help of ApkTool) and now it should work without any problems.

Note: for system apks and frameworks, I will come up with a solution later.
